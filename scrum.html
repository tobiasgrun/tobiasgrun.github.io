     <h1 id="overview">Scrum</h1>
     <p>In my approach to product development, I follow the principles and framework of <a href="https://www.scrum.org/" alt="Scrum.org Website" target="_blank">Scrum</a> 
        an agile and lightweight yet powerful methodology for delivering complex products. Scrum’s iterative nature and emphasis on collaboration enable me to focus on maximizing 
        value by continuously prioritizing and delivering increments that align with stakeholder needs and the product vision. By fostering transparency, inspection, and adaptation, 
        Scrum creates an environment where teams thrive, customer feedback drives improvements, and goals are achieved efficiently. I value Scrum for its ability to empower teams, 
        enhance communication, and respond effectively to changing requirements, ensuring a dynamic and user-focused development process.</p>

    <h1 id="my_approach">My Approach</h1>
    <p>As a <strong>Product Owner</strong>, my role is to maximize the value delivered by the Scrum Team by maintaining a well-prioritized Product Backlog, fostering collaboration, 
        and ensuring alignment with the product vision. Through each event in the Scrum framework, I bridge the gap between stakeholders and the development team, ensuring that every 
        increment contributes meaningfully to the product's success.</p>
    <p>For the development of <strong>requirements</strong>, I use design thinking and a variety of creative techniques to collaborate with users and stakeholders in developing 
        requirements. This approach helps me understand their needs through empathy, defining their challenges and ideating solutions that are both innovative and user-centric. 
        In situations where direct collaboration with a group is not possible, I create personas to represent the different user and stakeholder profiles, allowing me to make 
        informed decisions based on real-world scenarios. Techniques like journey mapping, brainstorming, and storyboarding are also essential in visualizing user experiences, 
        identifying pain points, and refining requirements. These methods ensure that the developed requirements are not only clear and actionable but also aligned with user 
        expectations and business goals. My training and experience in <a href="https://grun-portfolio.github.io/requirements_engineering.html" alt="Requirements Engineering Site" target="_blank">Requirements Engineering</a> 
        is an additional advantage in developing clear and relevant Product Backlog Items (PBI).</p>
    <p>In <strong>Sprint Planning</strong>, I collaborate closely with the Scrum Team to define the Sprint Goal and select high-priority items from the Product Backlog to include 
        in the Sprint. As a Product Owner, I ensure that the selected items align with the overarching product vision and business objectives. I clarify requirements, answer 
        questions, and refine user stories to help the team understand what is needed for successful implementation.</p>
    <p>Throughout the <strong>Sprint</strong>, I engage with the Scrum Team to provide ongoing support and clarification. I am readily available to answer questions, refine 
        acceptance criteria, and provide feedback on the team’s progress. My role is to ensure the team remains focused on delivering value aligned with the Sprint Goal while 
        avoiding unnecessary distractions or changes during the Sprint.</p>
    <p>In the <strong>Daily Scrums</strong>, while I do not actively participate in managing the team’s progress, I attend to stay informed about any challenges or impediments 
        that could impact the delivery of the Sprint Goal. This allows me to provide support or context when needed without interfering with the team's autonomy.</p>
    <p>During the <strong>Sprint Review</strong>, I facilitate collaboration between the Scrum Team and stakeholders to inspect the increment and gather feedback. I ensure that 
        the review provides stakeholders with a clear understanding of what has been delivered and its alignment with the product vision. Feedback gathered during this meeting 
        informs adjustments to the Product Backlog, keeping it responsive to stakeholder needs and market changes.</p>
    <p>In the <strong>Sprint Retrospective</strong>, I support the team in reflecting on their processes and identifying opportunities for improvement. I use insights from these 
        discussions to refine my approach to backlog management, communication, and collaboration, fostering a culture of continuous improvement. As a firm believer in creating 
        psychologically safe workspaces, I encourage and value constructive feedback from all team members, recognizing it as essential for team growth and effectiveness.</p>
    <p>During the Sprints, the team and I focus on <strong>backlog refinement</strong>, continuously prioritizing and detailing user stories based on evolving stakeholder needs. 
        I work closely with stakeholders to gather requirements, evaluate feedback, and ensure the backlog is well-organized and ready for the next Sprint. This ongoing refinement 
        ensures that the team always has a clear and actionable set of items to work on.</p>
