     <h1 id="overview">NLP Sentiment Analysis of Yelp Reviews</h1>
     <p>This project focuses on applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews from the Yelp Open Dataset. 
        The goal is to classify individual reviews as positive, neutral, or negative based on customer sentiment, and then aggregate these sentiments at the 
        business or store level. By analyzing sentiment trends, the project aims to identify key areas for improvement and predict potential impacts on sales and 
        customer satisfaction.</p>

        <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>    
        <p>In industries where customer feedback holds significant influence —such as dining, hospitality, and retail— sentiment analysis has proven being a powerful 
            tool for targeted improvements to stay competitive by increasing customer satisfaction.</p>
        <p>Meet <a href="assets/images/sites/nlp_sentiment_analysis/persona.png" alt="Persona description" class="openModal">Lorena Castillo</a>, a fictitious Regional 
            Manager of First Watch restaurants in the Tampa, Florida area. As many other regional managers —maybe just like you— she saw the potential to increase customer value and 
            revenue for her locations through professional sentiment analyses. Follow her journey to discover how her data analyst transformed raw customer feedback 
            into business insights by classifying reviews as positive, negative, or neutral and aggregating the data at the store level. Learn how sentiment analysis 
            can support evidence-based decisions that drive business performance and create customer value.</p>

        <h1 id="scenario">Scenario (fictitious)</h1>    
        <p><a href="assets/images/sites/nlp_sentiment_analysis/persona.png" alt="Persona description" class="openModal">Lorena Castillo</a> took on the role of Regional Manager 
            for First Watch Restaurants around Tampa, Florida in <abbr title="The publicly available dataset ranges from 2015 through 2022 with a considerable drop of reviews after 2019. In order to conduct a strong analyses on the available data, the scenario takes place in the end of 2019.">October 2019</abbr>. 
            After taking over operations, she realized that the restaurant performance metrics across various locations were poorly tracked and inconsistantly reported. Additionally, 
            customer satisfaction analyses were sparse and outdated, making it difficult to gauge how well stores were performing.<br>
            To develop a strong strategy for enhancing restaurant operations, improving customer experience and increasing profitability, Lorena needed a clear understanding 
            of the current situation at each location. While reviewing customer feedback from various online sources, she quickly became overwhelmed by the sheer volume of 
            unorganized data and conflicting opinions.<br>
            Lorena decided to seek professional support for the analysis from a reliable service provider. Understanding the urgency of the project, she reached out to four 
            consulting firms for proposals, looking for an analyses delivering clear insights on customer feedback and recommendations to address potential issues in a timely manner.<br>
            Lorena reviewed several proposals, and selected the proposal with me as data analyst since it vontained a detailed, transparent, and problem-focused approach. 
            This proposal exactly provided her with the analyses she needed to make informed decisions for the entire region.</p>
        <h2>Scope of the analysis</h2>
        <p>After working closely with Lorena and understanding her needs, we identified the following outcomes to enhance customer satisfaction and business success:</p>
        <ul>
         <li>Assess current customer satisfaction across all First Watch locations in her managed region to gain a clear understanding of overall business health.</li>
         <li>Conduct a comparative analysis across locations to identify top-performing and underperforming stores.</li>
          <li>Analyze patterns across different stores to uncover opportunities for improving customer service and product offerings, ultimately enhancing the customer experience.</li>
          <li>Evaluate operational efficiencies and inefficiencies across locations to define and implement standardized best practices.</li>
           <li>Identify and prioritize improvement areas with the highest potential impact on customer satisfaction to generate value quickly.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In this project, I am using customer review data provided by <a href="https://www.yelp.com" target="_blank" alt="yelp.com">Yelp</a>. 
            Yelp offers two methods of data access: <a href="https://www.yelp.com/dataset" target="_blank" alt="Yelp Open Dataset">Yelp Open Dataset</a> and 
		<a href="https://www.fusion.yelp.com" target="_blank" alt="Yelp Fusion API">Yelp Fusion</a>.</p>
        <p>Yelp Fusion <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> provides real-time data but imposes several restrictions. Customer reviews are 
            limited in both the number of requests that can be made per day and the number of characters in each review. Additionally, data retrieved through 
            <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> can only be cached for 24 hours, and the process of retrieving data can be time-consuming. 
            These limitations can complicate data analysis, especially when it is important to use the same dataset for maintaining reproducibility throughout the project.</p>
        <p>For these reasons, I have chosen to use Yelp’s Open Dataset, which is publicly and freely accessible through 
            <a href="https://www.yelp.com/dataset/download" target="_blank" alt="Yelp's Open Dataset Download">Yelp Open Data Download</a> site. Yelp generously provides the Open 
	    Dataset for non-commercial personal, educational, and academic purposes and rightfully prohibits the uncontrolled redistribution of their data. To comply with Yelp's 
	    Terms of Service, I will not save the Open Dataset or derivates of it in my repository. Instead, please download the Open Dataset directly from 
	    <a href="https://www.yelp.com/dataset" target="_blank" alt="Yelp Open Dataset">Yelp's Open Dataset</a> website to run the script.</p>
