#### Water quality monitoring (Dashboard)

In this project, I develop a Power BI dashboard to analyze and monitor water quality data form Floridaâ€™s gulf coast through visualization techniques. The goal is to provide a concise and easy to understand dashboard with visualizations that inform about the water quality of economically important areas.



#### Water quality monitoring (Dashboard)

The Data 
Data visualization techniques are used to show current and past water quality indicators and predict trends in kew water indicators over a large area. The visualization of water parameters and associated analyses allow to make decisions about water quality for the public (is it safe to swim), nature conservation policies (do we have to change something), and also the local property values (good water quality mean higher property values). The analysis integrates synthetic data generation and visualization to interpret large and complex, multifaceted ecological data. This project translates large-scale datasets into accessible insights and guiding evidence-based decision-making.



#### Introduction
Florida's Gulf Coast is one of the most beautiful and idyllic regions known to mankind. The shore is defined by white sandy beaches, warm waters, palmtrees, and mangrove forests. Particularly the central and south region spanning from Marco Island to Clearwater is known for the wonderful, wide, and endless fine-sanded beaches. It is no surprise that one can find clusters of most esthetic beachfront mansions in these areas. However, Florida's Gulf Coast has its own set of challenges like notorious hurricanes that can render insuring the valuable property a hopeless endeavour. Residents and tourists alike face another brutal, yet often invisible challenge - the intrinsic content of the water. Pollutants like heavy metals, red-tide events, and harmful algae blooms (HABs) terrorize Florida's halcyon Gulf Coast.

In this project, the waterquality of Florida's scenic Gulf Coast is monitored. Recorded data are presented in the form of dashboards and reports publisthed online that allow the public to obtain a concise overview of the current water quality situation and find detailed reports of trends and patterns.


#### Scenario (fictitious)
After the phosphate mine leakage in 2023, residents of Florida's central and southern Gulf Coast where terrified about the health hazards that could lure in the waters so close to their homes. They found that it is time to put a monitoring system in place that records critical water parameters that are associated with health hazards such as algae blooming events and water pollution of dangerous levels. The alliance of residents was able to secure enough funds and all required permits to get water quality monitoring station installed at seven locations on the Sunshine State's coast spanning from Clearwater Beach in the north to Sanibel Island in the south. The Oceanic Engineering Firm that developed and installed the monitoring stations assigned me with the development of dashboard and reports that visualize recorded measurements and provide intuitive and detailled insights into the data so that residents and the general public can make best decisions for their recreational activities and environmental conservation organisations can use the data for data-driven actions.

##### Scope
After a careful requirements analysis with stakeholders, we together identified the following requirements for the dashboards and reports:
* Dashboard and reports will be developed in Microsoft Power BI, a standard tool for advanced visualizations.
* One dashboard showing the locations of the seven locations on a map with the current water quality as a gauge diagramm.
* The dashboard is interactive, by selecting a location (drilldown), the viewer will be forwarded to a report and sees all current water parameters of the location in the form of a diagram that shows the current value of the parameter on a scale that is divided in good, critical, and high values.
* The report is interactive, by selecting a value (drillthrough), the viewer will be forwarded to a detailed report that shows a table of the recorded values and a line plot that shows patterns and trends.
