Water quality monitoring (Dashboard)

In this project, I develop a Power BI dashboard to analyze and monitor water quality data form Floridaâ€™s gulf coast through visualization techniques. The goal is to provide a concise and easy to understand dashboard with visualizations that inform about the water quality of economically important areas.



Water quality monitoring (Dashboard)

The Data 
Data visualization techniques are used to show current and past water quality indicators and predict trends in kew water indicators over a large area. The visualization of water parameters and associated analyses allow to make decisions about water quality for the public (is it safe to swim), nature conservation policies (do we have to change something), and also the local property values (good water quality mean higher property values). The analysis integrates synthetic data generation and visualization to interpret large and complex, multifaceted ecological data. This project translates large-scale datasets into accessible insights and guiding evidence-based decision-making.



Scenario (fictitious)
Florida's Gulf Coast is one of the most beautiful and idyllic regions known to mankind. The shore is defined by white sandy beaches, warm waters, palmtrees, and mangrove forests. Particularly the central and south region spanning from Marco Island to Clearwater is known for the wonderful, wide, and endless fine-sanded beaches. It is no surprise that one can find clusters of most esthetic beachfront mansions in these areas. However, Florida's Gulf Coast has its own set of challenges like notorious hurricanes that can render insuring the valuable property a hopeless endeavour. Residents and tourists alike face another brutal, yet often invisible challenge - the intrinsic content of the water. Pollutants like heavy metals, red-tide events, and harmful algae blooms (HABs) terrorize Florida's halcyon Gulf Coast.
In early 2023, an alliance of wealthy property owner from Sanibel Island in the south to Clearwater Beach in the north formed to tackle these challenges.
