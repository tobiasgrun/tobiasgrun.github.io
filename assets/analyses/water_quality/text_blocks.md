Water quality monitoring (Dashboard)

In this project, I develop a Power BI dashboard to analyze and monitor water quality data form Floridaâ€™s gulf coast through visualization techniques. The goal is to provide a concise and easy to understand dashboard with visualizations that inform about the water quality of economically important areas.


The Data 
Data visualization techniques are used to show current and past water quality indicators and predict trends for algae bloom events over a large area. The visualization of water parameters and associated analyses allow to make decisions about water quality for the public (is it safe to swim), nature conservation policies (do we have to change something), and also the local property values (good water quality mean higher property values). The analysis integrates synthetic data generation and visualization to interpret large and complex, multifaceted ecological data. This project translates large-scale datasets into accessible insights and guiding evidence-based decision-making.
