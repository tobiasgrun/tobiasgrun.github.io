2. A hero section with a full-width image (replace with "hero-image.jpg") above the title "Pioneering the Future of Ocean Technology" and a description: "At ScyllaWorks, we design and develop cutting-edge marine engineering solutions, from high-precision underwater sensors to autonomous exploration vehicles."
3. A services section with four service blocks, each containing:
- An image (replace with appropriate image filenames like "sensor.jpg", "weather_station.jpg", etc.)
- A title (e.g., "Custom Underwater Sensors")
- A brief description of the service (e.g., "High-precision sensors for environmental monitoring, research, and industrial applications").
4. A content section titled "Our Expertise", with details about four key areas: "Custom-Manufactured Underwater Sensors", "Offshore Weather Stations", "IoT and Smart Sensor Integration", and "Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs)".
5. A section titled "Who We Serve" with a list of sectors such as "Government Agencies", "Marine Research Institutions & Universities", etc.
6. A section titled "What Sets Us Apart", highlighting industry leadership, innovation, and custom-engineered solutions.
7. A section titled "Innovative Projects Driving the Future" showcasing examples like "Deep-Sea Autonomous Sensor Network" and "Advanced Naval Sonar Systems".
8. A contact section with the title "Contact Us" and an email link (info@scyllaworks.com).
Use a dark color scheme with shades of blue and white text, and make the layout responsive using flexbox for the services section. Include proper section styling for clean and organized visuals.
