     <h1>Hi, my name is Tobias B. Grun</h1>
     <p>I am a research scientist with a strong focus on data analysis to develop innovative technological solutions in cross-functional teams. My academic journey began with 
         biomimetic research and marine science, where I discovered the power of data as a tool for understanding biological and environmental patterns and processes that lead 
         to new insights for the solution of complex questions. Statistical programming became my happy place and over time I consequently shifted my work towards data analyses, 
         and programming became an essential part of both my work and personal projects, such as developing websites like this portfolio, and home automation systems with Raspberry Pi. 
         To enhance my expertise, I pursued advanced training in Machine Learning, enabling me to perform even more advanced analyses.</p>
     <p>Driven by my passion for innovation, I transitioned from academic research into applied software development where I combined my analytical skills with Agile methodologies 
         and rigorous requirements engineering. My work thrives at the intersection of advanced analytical techniques and collaborative, Agile-driven development, creating innovative 
         technical products. The combination is the sweet-spot where I excel.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://tobiasgrun.github.io/nlp_sentiment_analysis.html" target="_self">NLP Sentiment Analysis of Yelp Reviews</a></h2>
        <p>In this machine learning project, I use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze and classify customer reviews from Yelp. The goal is to accurately identify the sentiment of reviews, 
            categorizing them as positive, negative, or neutral, providing insights into customer opinions.</p>
        <h2>Recommender Engine</h2>
        <p>I use the recommender system for collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and deep learning to analyze user behavior and preferences. This allows me to personalize suggestions, 
            enhance user experience, and increase engagement across various industries like entertainment services.</p>
        <h2>Customer Churn Prediction</h2>
        <p>The objective of this project is to build a predictive model to forecast customer churn for a telecommunications company based on customer demographics, account details, and service usage data. 
            The project aims to identify key factors influencing customer retention that can be used for data-driven business decisions.</p>
        <h2>Global Nutrition and Obesity Trends</h2>
        <p>In this project, I explore global nutrition and obesity data to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations through clustering techniques and data visualization. The goal is to provide a 
            comprehensive analysis that can inform health policy and interventions on a global scale.</p>
        <h2><a href="https://tobiasgrun.github.io/biomimetic_research.html" target="_self">Biomimetic Research</a></h2>
        <p>Biomimetic Research is an integrative approach combining biology and engineering sciences to address complex technical challenges. By examining evolved biological structures, 
            biomimetics seeks to extract working principles of biological role models that inspire innovative technical solutions. This process relies on computational analysis and mathematical 
            descriptions of the role models to manage and interpret intricate biological data, transforming raw observations into technical solutions. Through rigorous data analysis, biomimetics 
            turns the complexity of natural systems into a framework for advancing technology.</p>
        <h2><a href="https://tobiasgrun.github.io/ecological_research.html" target="_self">Ecological Research</a></h2>
        <p>In my ecological research, I study how marine organisms interact within their ecosystems, focusing on biotic interactions, spatial distribution patterns, 
            environmental factors, and habitat relationships. By combining field observations with experimental and analytical methods, I aim to understand how marine 
            organisms interact with their environments and how that affects biodiversity and ecosystem resilience.</p>
        <h2><a href="https://tobiasgrun.github.io/sunshine_unit.html" target="_self">Sunshine Unit</a></h2>
        <p>In this Python project, I use a Raspberry Pi and RGB LED strip to create a sunrise effect, gradually transitioning in brightness from low to high while shifting from 
            dark orange (early sunrise) to full-spectrum daylight. Designed as a gentle wake-up experience, this project combines Python scripting and hardware to create a custom 
            ambient light simulation with a soothing, high-impact effect for the user.</p>
