     <h1>Hi, my name is Tobias B. Grun</h1>
     <p>I am a research scientist with a strong focus on data analysis to develop innovative technological solutions in cross-functional teams. My academic journey began with 
         biomimetic research and marine science, where I discovered the power of data as a tool for understanding biological and environmental patterns and processes that lead 
         to new insights for the solution of complex questions. Statistical programming became my happy place and over time I consequently shifted my work towards data analyses, 
         and programming became an essential part of both my work and personal projects, such as developing websites like this portfolio, and home automation systems with Raspberry Pi. 
         To enhance my expertise, I pursued advanced training in Machine Learning, enabling me to perform even more advanced analyses.</p>
     <p>Driven by my passion for innovation, I transitioned from academic research into applied software development where I combined my analytical skills with Agile methodologies 
         and rigorous requirements engineering. My work thrives at the intersection of advanced analytical techniques and collaborative, Agile-driven development, creating innovative 
         technical products. The combination is the sweet-spot where I excel.</p>
