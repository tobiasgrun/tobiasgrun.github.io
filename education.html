     <h1>Hi, my name is Tobias B. Grun</h1>
     <p>I am a research scientist with a deep passion for data science, statistical analyses, and programming. I became interested in data analysis early in my career as a marine scientist, 
         where I discovered the power of data as a tool for understanding environmental patterns and processes. Statistical programming became my happy place and over time I consequently 
         shifted my work towards data analyses, and programming became an essential part of both my work and personal projects, such as developing websites like this portfolio, and home automation 
         systems with Raspberry Pi. To deepen my skills, I pursued advanced training in Machine Learning, which further fueled my enthusiasm for data science.</p>
