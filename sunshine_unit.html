     <p>This project is a custom sunrise simulation using a Raspberry Pi 4B and an RGB LED light strip. It mimics a natural sunrise by gradually increasing 
       the brightness and adjusting the LED colors through precise control of each channel using the pigpio library and MOSFETs. Beginning with dark orange, the 
       light transitions to full-spectrum daylight over 30 minutes. Once full brightness and daylight color are reached, the system maintains this illumination 
       for one hour, offering a consistent and gentle wake-up experience.</p>

	<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>    
        <p>The idea for a sunrise simulation came to life during the winter of 2023 after we moved to Germany. If you've experienced winter here, you know — nights are long, 
		dark, and utterly committed to making weekend mornings an exercise in sheer willpower. More often than not, it’s that obnoxious alarm that shocks you awake, 
		leaving you to wonder why you bothered setting it in the first place.</p>
	<p>I stumbled across alarm clocks designed to wake you up with a blend of light and sound. The concept of gradually increasing brightness sounded dreamy — until 
		I tried it and discovered these lights barely rivaled a dim nightlight. That was when the idea of building my own sunrise 
		simulator came to me. Not only would it brighten our mornings, but it could also serve as a little project to survive the hostile German winter.</p>
	<p>After some research, I came to the conclusion that Raspberry Pi would be the best option to kickstart my project. I had never worked with a single-board computer 
		before, neither had I ever configured a hardwired LED setup. But hey, stepping out of the scripting comfort zone is half the fun I thought!</p>
    </article>

        <h1 id="hardware_setup">Hardware Setup</h1>    
        <p>The hardware configuration seemed straightforward at first glance: the Raspberry Pi has a set of pins that allow it to send and receive signals. Naturally, one might 
		think all it takes is to connect the red, green, and blue channels to the Raspberry Pi’s pins and let the Python code control the LED.
	<p>However, as with most things in life, there’s more to it. First, it’s important to understand how the LED strip works. Unlike light bulbs that can be dimmed by 
		regulating current, LEDs are quickly turned on and off. The longer the LED is off, the dimmer it appears. This effect is called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). 
		Therefore, it’s essential to find the pins on the Raspberry Pi that natively support PWM for this setup.</p>
	<p>Once you have that figured out, the next question is how much power the Raspberry Pi's pins can supply, and whether that’s enough for a power-hungry LED strip. 
		The answer according to most sources is "no". This is where the setup enters a completely different realm beyond simple scripting and wiring. We now need 
		MOSFETs, a breadboard, and other components. Fortunately, there are experts who have already figured out what parts are needed, how to calculate their properties, 
		and even compiled shopping lists with links to purchase them.</p>
	<p>For everything hardware-related, I recommend checking out an online source like <a href="https://dordnung.de/raspberrypi-ledstrip/en" target="_blank">David Ordnung’s</a> 
	        blog, which covers how to set up an LED strip with a Raspberry Pi.</p>

    <p>With the working script, you now only need to tell your Raspberry Pi to run the script on your dream schedule, e.g., every Saturday and Sunday at 10 AM. 
      I use cron to achieve this:</p>
    <div class="code-container">
	<pre><code>
crontab -e
0 10 * * 6,7 /usr/bin/python3 /scripts/sunrise_simulation.py
        </code></pre>
