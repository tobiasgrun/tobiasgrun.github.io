     <h1 id="overview">Water Quality Monitoring</h1>
     <p>Data visualization techniques are used to display current and historical water quality indicators and predict trends in key water parameters across a 
	     large area. Visualizing these parameters, along with the associated analyses, enables informed decision-making on water quality for the public, 
	     such as determining whether the water is safe for swimming, guiding nature conservation policies on whether any changes are necessary, and 
	     influencing local property values, as good water quality often leads to higher property values.<br>
	     The analysis integrates synthetic data generation and visualization to interpret large, complex, and multifaceted ecological datasets. 
	     This project transforms vast datasets into accessible insights, supporting evidence-based decision-making for both residents and policymakers.</p>

	<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>    
        <p>Florida's Gulf Coast is one of the most breathtaking and idyllic regions in the world. Its shoreline is defined by white sandy beaches, warm waters, 
		palm trees, and vast mangrove forests. The central and southern sections, stretching from Marco Island to Clearwater Beach, are particularly 
		renowned for their wide, endless beaches with fine, powdery sand. It's no surprise that some of the most stunning beachfront mansions can be 
		found here.<br>
		This paradise comes with its own challenges. Devastating hurricanes make insuring these valuable properties a daunting task. Residents and 
		tourists yet face another, often invisible threat—the very waters they admire so much. Pollutants such as heavy metals, red tide events, and 
		harmful algal blooms (HABs) pose a persistent and growing risk to Florida’s tranquil Gulf Coast.<br>
		This fictitious project monitors the water quality of Florida's scenic Gulf Coast. The collected data is presented through interactive dashboards 
		and detailed reports published online, providing the public with a clear overview of current water conditions as well as in-depth insights into 
		trends and patterns.</p>

          <h1 id="scenario">Scenario</h1>    
          <p>Following the phosphate mine leak in 2023, residents of Florida’s central and southern Gulf Coast were deeply concerned about the potential health 
		  hazards and its negative impact on their property value posed by contaminated waters near their homes. Recognizing the urgency, they decided to 
		  implement a monitoring system that tracks critical water parameters related to health risks, such as algal blooms and dangerous levels of 
		  pollution. The community coalition secured the necessary funding and permits to install water quality monitoring stations at seven locations 
		  along the Sunshine State’s coast, from Clearwater Beach in the north to Sanibel Island in the south.<br>
		  The Oceanic Engineering Firm, which developed and installed the monitoring stations, tasked me with creating dashboards and reports to visualize 
		  the collected data. The goal was to provide intuitive and detailed insights, helping residents, the general public, and environmental 
		  conservation organizations make informed decisions regarding recreational activities and data-driven conservation actions to reduce health 
		  hazards and plumbing property values.</p>
	<h2>Scope</h2>
	    <p>Through a comprehensive requirements analysis with stakeholders, we identified the following key requirements for the dashboards and reports:</p>
		    <ul>
			    <li>Dashboards and reports will be developed using Microsoft Power BI, a leading tool for advanced visualizations.</li>
			    <li>One dashboard will display the locations of the seven monitoring stations on a map, with current water quality shown using a gauge diagram.</li>
			    <li>The dashboard is interactive: by selecting a location (drilldown), users will be directed to a detailed report displaying the current water parameters for that location. Each parameter is presented with a visual scale indicating whether it is within good, critical, or high values.</li>
			    <li>The report is interactive: by selecting a parameter value (drillthrough), users will be taken to a detailed report showing recorded values in a table, along with a line plot that reveals patterns and trends over time.</li>

        <h1 id="data_analysis">Data Analysis</h1>    
            <p>Water quality data are readily accessible online, with many sources offering free use. However, complying with the policies set by data owners can be challenging, 
		    as these policies can change over time. For this project, it was essential to share both the original data and its derivatives. To ensure compliance with current 
		    and future data policies and to avoid potential violations, I opted to use synthetically generated data.<br>
		    The Python script used for data generation is provided below and is set up to ensure reproducibility. This means that every time the script is run, the same 
		    synthetic data will be produced.</p>

          <p>"I will take great care," said Little Red Riding Hood to her mother, and gave her hand on it.<br>
		  The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village, and just as Little Red Riding Hood entered the wood, a wolf met her. 
		  Little Red Riding Hood did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid 
		  of him.</p>

		  "Thank you kindly, wolf."<br>
		  "Whither away so early, Little Red Riding Hood?"<br>
		  "To my grandmother's."<br>
		  "What have you got in your apron?"<br>
		  "Cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger."<br> 
		  "Where does your grandmother live, Little Red Riding Hood?"<br>
		  "A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; her house stands under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below; you surely must know it," 
		  replied Little Red Riding Hood.</p>
