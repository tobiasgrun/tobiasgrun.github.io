     <p>Data visualization and clustering methods are used to show global trends in nutrition and obesity, allowing to reveal global and regional public health patterns. 
	     The analysis integrates data cleaning, visualization, and clustering to interpret complex, multifaceted health data. This process translates large-scale datasets 
	     into accessible insights, guiding evidence-based decision-making in global health.</p>

	<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>    
        <p>Once upon a time, there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was nothing 
		that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a little cap made of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never wear 
		anything else; so she was always called Little Red Riding Hood.</p>
    </article> 

    <article>
          <h1 id="data_repository">Data Repository</h1>    
          <p>One day her mother said to her: "Come, Little Red Riding Hood, here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother, she is ill and weak, 
		  and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path, or you may fall and break 
		  the bottle, and then your grandmother will get nothing. And when you go into her room, don’t forget to say good morning, and don’t peep into every corner before 
		  you do it."</p>
    </article>

          <h1 id="data_analysis">Data Analysis</h1>    
          <p>"I will take great care," said Little Red Riding Hood to her mother, and gave her hand on it.<br>
		  The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village, and just as Little Red Riding Hood entered the wood, a wolf met her. 
		  Little Red Riding Hood did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid 
		  of him.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
          <h1 id="results">Results</h1>    
          <p>"Good day, Little Red Riding Hood," said he.<br>
		  "Thank you kindly, wolf."<br>
		  "Whither away so early, Little Red Riding Hood?"<br>
		  "To my grandmother's."<br>
		  "What have you got in your apron?"<br>
		  "Cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger."<br> 
		  "Where does your grandmother live, Little Red Riding Hood?"<br>
		  "A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; her house stands under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below; you surely must know it," 
		  replied Little Red Riding Hood.</p>
