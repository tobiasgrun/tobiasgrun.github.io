     <p>In my approach to project management, I follow the <a href="https://pmi.org" alt="Project Management Institute Website" target="_blank">Project Management Institute (PMI)</a> 
        <a href="https://www.pmi.org/standards/pmbok" alt="Project Management Professional Website" target="_blank">Project Management Professional (PMP)</a> standards to ensure a 
        structured and systematic process for successfully delivering projects. I focus on defining clear project goals, establishing a detailed project scope, and creating a solid 
        plan that aligns with stakeholder expectations. Through careful management of time, cost, quality, resources, and risks, I ensure that projects are executed efficiently, 
        meet objectives, and deliver value. I also emphasize continuous communication and collaboration with stakeholders to ensure alignment throughout the project lifecycle, 
        from initiation to closure.</p>

    <h1 id="my_approach">My Approach</h1>
    <p>In the traditional projects I manage, I adhere to <a href="https://pmi.org" alt="Project Management Institute Website" target="_blank">Project Management Institute (PMI)</a> 
        <a href="https://www.pmi.org/standards/pmbok" alt="Project Management Professional Website" target="_blank">Project Management Professional (PMP)</a> 
        standards and procedures, as they are widely recognized and have proven effective for managing complex projects. I am also currently undergoing training for the 
        <a href="https://pmi.org" alt="Project Management Institute Website" target="_blank">Project Management Institute (PMI)</a> 
        <a href="https://www.pmi.org/standards/pmbok" alt="Project Management Professional Website" target="_blank">Project Management Professional (PMP)</a> Certification to further 
        enhance my expertise in this methodology.</p>
    <p>In the <strong>Initiation Phase</strong>, I define the project’s purpose and objectives, ensuring alignment with stakeholder expectations. This includes the development of 
        a Project Charter, which provides a high-level overview of the project goals, stakeholders, and constraints. By clearly establishing the project’s foundation, I ensure that 
        all stakeholders are aligned and committed to the project’s success from the outset.</p>
    <p>During the <strong>Planning Phase</strong>, I focus on clearly defining the project scope. This involves gathering detailed requirements from stakeholders, analyzing their 
        needs, and setting clear deliverables. In traditional projects, I use <a href=https://grun-portfolio.github.io/requirements_engineering.html alt=”Requirements Engineering Site” target=”_blank”>requirements engineering</a> techniques to gather, analyze, specify, validate, and document requirements. The goal is to create a comprehensive scope statement that defines the boundaries of the project and establishes what will and will not be included. This step ensures that the project team has a shared understanding of the project’s objectives and prevents scope creep throughout the project lifecycle.</p>
    <p>Once the scope is defined, I proceed to develop a <strong>Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)</strong>. The WBS breaks the project down into smaller, manageable tasks or work 
        packages. This structured breakdown ensures that no aspect of the project is overlooked and helps in estimating time, costs, and resources. The WBS also provides a clear 
        roadmap for the team, enabling better tracking and control over project progress.</p>
    <p>In parallel with the WBS, I develop a detailed <strong>Project Schedule</strong>. This includes identifying task dependencies, setting milestones, and allocating resources. 
        By developing a realistic and achievable schedule, I provide the project team with a clear timeline to follow, ensuring that all tasks are completed on time and within scope. 
        Accurate scheduling is essential to prevent delays and keep the project on track.</p>
    <p><strong>Risk management</strong> is a continuous activity that begins in the Planning Phase with the identification of potential risks. I develop a Risk Management Plan, 
        assess risks, and define mitigation strategies. Proactively addressing risks reduces the likelihood of surprises during the project execution phase and ensures that I can 
        respond to issues quickly if they arise.</p>
    <p>In the <strong>Project Executing Phase</strong>, I focus on coordinating resources and managing stakeholder engagement. This includes ensuring that team members have the 
        necessary tools and support to carry out their tasks. Effective communication is key during this phase to keep stakeholders informed and engaged, and to address any issues 
        or changes in a timely manner.</p>
    <p><strong>Monitoring and Controlling</strong> is an ongoing process throughout the project, ensuring that the project stays aligned with its objectives. I track project 
        performance against the baseline schedule and budget, and address any variances. This involves regular status meetings, performance reviews, and reporting. If necessary, 
        I implement corrective actions to bring the project back on track. The goal of this process is to ensure that the project remains within scope, on schedule, and on budget.</p>
    <p>In the <strong>Closing Phase</strong>, I finalize all project activities, ensuring that deliverables meet the specified requirements. I conduct a final review with 
        stakeholders to ensure satisfaction and formalize acceptance. This phase includes documentation and knowledge transfer, as well as closing out contracts and releasing 
        resources. By formally closing the project, I ensure that all objectives have been met and that the project’s success is recognized.</p>
