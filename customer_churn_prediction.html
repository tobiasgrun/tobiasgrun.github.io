     <h1 id="overview">Customer Churn Prediction</h1>
     <p>Predictive modeling in customer churn analysis aims to forecast customer behavior by combining statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms. 
	     By examining customer demographics, account details, and usage data, this approach identifies patterns and factors driving customer retention and churn. 
	     The process integrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, and predictive modeling to optimize customer engagement strategies, reduce churn, 
	     and enhance overall business performance.</p>

        <p>Once upon a time there was a kind girl named Cinderella. She lived with her stepmother and two stepsisters, who treated her poorly. 
		They made her do all the work around the house and gave her the worst room in the attic to sleep in. Despite her hard life, Cinderella 
		remained gentle and kind, always hopeful that her luck would change.</p>

          <p>One day, the King announced that he would hold a grand ball, inviting all the young women in the kingdom so that the Prince could choose a bride. 
          Cinderella's stepsisters were overjoyed and spent hours planning their dresses and hairstyles. But when Cinderella asked if she could go, her 
          stepmother mocked her and said that a dirty girl like her had no place at the ball. Instead, she gave Cinderella even more chores to keep her busy 
          while they prepared for the event.</p>

          <p>The poor girl had to do all the hard work in the house; she got up early in the morning, drew water, made the fire, cooked, and washed. 
		  Besides this, the two sisters did everything imaginable to make her life miserable — they mocked her, scattered peas and lentils among the 
		  ashes and made her pick them up. In the evening, when she was quite tired with her hard day's work, she had no bed to lie down on but was obliged 
		  to rest on the hearth among the cinders. And because she always looked dusty and dirty, they named her Cinderella.</p>

          <p>It happened one day that the father was going to the fair, and he asked his two stepdaughters what he should bring back for them. "Fine clothes," said one; 
		  "Pearls and diamonds," said the other. "But what will you have, Cinderella?" said he. "The first twig, dear father, that brushes against your hat on your 
		  way home," said she. So he bought fine clothes, pearls, and diamonds for his two stepdaughters, and on his way back, as he rode through a green thicket, 
		  a hazel twig brushed against him and knocked off his hat. So he broke off the branch and took it with him.</p>
